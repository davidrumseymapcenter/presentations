						Hi everyone, it's a pleasure to welcome you to the David Rumsey Map Center. I'm going to start with an introduction to the Center, providing a brief overview of our activities, as well as how you might connect with us in the future. I'm Evan Thornberry, I am the head curator here at the Center. Although I've only been part of this remarkable team for a few months, I've had the privilege of working alongside our exceptional staff and collaborating with David and others to fulfill our mission.

						The Map Center consists of five dedicated staff members, and we work together to facilitate the use of historical cartographic materials for teaching, learning, and research. Our ultimate goal is to inspire a sense of spatial curiosity about the world, its peoples, and their histories.

					<aside class="notes">
						Here at the Center, we're responsible for curating and stewarding Stanford University Library's historical map collections, which in large part consists of the Collections of David Rumsey. We are here to make these collections easily accessible, understandable, and useful. We actively promote engagement with historical maps, whether in their physical form or as digital objects, encouraging their use as valuable data sources. By digitizing and making this material accessible virtually, we accelerate the integration of historical maps into digital and online environments. In that sense, a key part of our mission is to foster and promote exploration through the use of historical materials and modern technology. And I'll note that this isn't always about exploring the geographic phenomena found on maps, but also the story behind the map, or the other things that might be left off the map.
